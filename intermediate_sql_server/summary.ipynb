    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A majority of data is stored in databases and knowing the necessary tools needed to analyze and clean data directly in databases is indispensable. This course focuses on T-SQL, the version of SQL used in Microsoft SQL Server, needed for data analysis. You will learn several concepts in this course such as dealing with missing data, working with dates, and calculating summary statistics using advanced queries. After completing this course, you will have the skills needed to analyze data and provide insights quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 Summarizing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first steps in data analysis is examining data through aggregations. This chapter explores how to create aggregations in SQL Server, a common first step in data exploration. You will also clean missing data and categorize data into bins with CASE statements.\n",
