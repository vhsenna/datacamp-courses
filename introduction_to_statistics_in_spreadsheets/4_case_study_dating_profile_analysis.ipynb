    "## Understanding the distribution of ages\n",

    "As an analyst at a social networking site trying to match like minded singles, you decide to first explore profile ages. This is a basic profile attribute but this alone is often an important factor in relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you might expect that most people searching for love will tend to be younger, you should verify this by using statistics to better understand the distribution of ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `D2`, calculate the mean age.\n",
    "2. In `E2`, identify the maximum age among all sampled user profiles.\n",

    "You'll revisit the [`COUNTIF()`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093480?hl=en) function you saw in an earlier exercise. Recall that this is like `COUNT()`, except it only counts an observation if a certain condition is met. For example, `COUNTIF(C2:C10, 1)` would only count observations between `C2` and `C10` if those observations were equal to `1`. Here, you'll use this to count the number of non-drinkers.\n",
