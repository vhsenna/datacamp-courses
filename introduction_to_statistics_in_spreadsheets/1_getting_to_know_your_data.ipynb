    "On the right is Amazon's quarterly revenue from their first year - 1996 - and a more recent year - 2017. Let's compare the mean and the median revenue between the two quarters to see how the data is distributed. The median is more robust to outliers, unlike the mean. So if your dataset has a lot of outliers, the mean will be pulled in the direction of the outliers.\n",
