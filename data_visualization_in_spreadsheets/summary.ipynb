    "\n",
    "A picture can tell a thousand words - but only if you use the right picture! This course teaches you the fundamentals of data visualization with Google Sheets. You'll learn how to create common chart types like bar charts, histograms, and scatter charts, as well as more advanced types, such as sparkline and candlestick charts. You will look at how to prepare your data and use Data Validation and VLookup formulas to target specific data to chart. You'll learn how to use Conditional Formatting to apply a format to a cell or a range of cells based on certain criteria, and finally, how to create a dashboard showing plots and data together. Along the way, you'll use data from the Olympics, sharks attacks, and Marine Technology from the ASX.\n",
