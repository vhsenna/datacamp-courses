    "1. In `A1` of `Sheet1`, use a formula that refers to the heading in your `Shark Attacks` dataset. This can take the form of `='Sheet Name'!A1`.\n",
    "2. In your `Shark Attacks` dataset, select the `State` column and the `Fatal`, `Injured`, and `Uninjured` statistics, and then create a chart.\n",
    "3. Copy and paste this chart to `Sheet 1` and change the chart to a column chart."
