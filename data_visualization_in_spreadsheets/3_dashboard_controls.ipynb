    "1. Remove the blank row and standardize your decimal places such that the numbers in columns `B:E` have three decimal places.\n",
    "2. Change the format of the date in `I1` so that it has the same format as the dates in `Column A`.\n",
    "    1. To do so you will need to select 'Format', and then 'Number' from the menu bar (or alternatively, you can use the '123' dropdown menu from the toolbar).\n",
