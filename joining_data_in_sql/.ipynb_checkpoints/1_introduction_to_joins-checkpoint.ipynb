    "\n",
    "Although this courses focuses on PostgreSQL, you'll find that these joins and the material here applies to different forms of SQL as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, you'll be working with the `countries` database containing information about the most populous world cities as well as country-level economic data, population data, and geographic data. This `countries` database also contains information on languages spoken in each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the different tables in this database by clicking on the corresponding tabs. Click through them to get a sense for the types of data that each table contains before you continue with the course! Take note of the fields that appear to be shared across the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the video the basic syntax for an `INNER JOIN`, here including all columns in **both** tables:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",

    "You'll start off with a `SELECT` statement and then build up to an `INNER JOIN` with the `cities` and `countries` tables. Let's get to it!\n",

    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begin by selecting all columns from the `cities` table.\n",
    "2. \n",
    "    1. Inner join the `cities` table on the left to the `countries` table on the right, keeping all of the fields in both tables.\n",
    "    2. You should match the tables on the `country_code` field in `cities` and the `code` field in `countries`.\n",
    "    3. **Do not** alias your tables here or in the next step. Using `cities` and `countries` is fine for now.\n",
    "3. \n",
    "    1. Modify the `SELECT` statement to keep only the name of the city, the name of the country, and the name of the region the country resides in.\n",
    "    2. Alias the name of the city `AS city` and the name of the country `AS country`."

    "In this exercise, you'll use the `populations` table to perform a self-join to calculate the percentage increase in population from 2010 to 2015 for each country code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you'll be joining the `populations` table to itself, you can alias `populations` as `p1` and also `populations` as `p2`. This is good practice whenever you are aliasing and your tables have the same first letter. Note that you are required to alias the tables with self-joins.\n",

    "    2. Select the `country_code` from `p1` and the `size` field from both `p1` and `p2`. SQL won't allow same-named fields, so alias `p1.size` as `size2010` and `p2.size` as `size2015`.\n",
    "2. \n",
    "    1. Notice from the result that for each `country_code` you have four entries laying out all combinations of 2010 and 2015.\n",
    "    2. Extend the `ON` in your query to include only those records where the `p1.year` (2010) matches with `p2.year - 5` (2015 - 5 = 2010). This will omit the three entries per `country_code` that you aren't interested in.\n",
    "3. As you just saw, you can also use SQL to calculate values like `p2.year - 5` for you. With two fields like `size2010` and `size2015`, you may want to determine the percentage increase from one field to the next: \n",
    "\n",
    "    With two numeric fields A and B, the percentage growth from A to B can be calculated as (B - A) / A * 100.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add a new field to `SELECT`, aliased as `growth_perc`, that calculates the percentage population growth from 2010 to 2015 for each country, using `p2.size` and `p1.size`."
