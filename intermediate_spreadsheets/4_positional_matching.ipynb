Some formulas may be easier to specify on one way or the other, so it's useful to know how to convert from one form to the other and back.\n",

    "\n",
    "A really important use of the cell addresses you made using [`ADDRESS()`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093308) is to get the value stored at that location. To do this, you use the [`INDIRECT()`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093377) function. (The name of the function comes from the computer science concept of _indirection_, where you pass the address of a variable in memory to a function rather than the variable itself.)\n",

    "If the cell `J42` contains the value `99`, then typing `=ADDRESS(42, 10)` in cell `J43` will give that cell a value of `$J$42`. Now the formula `=INDIRECT(\"J43\")` will return the value `99`.\n",

    "\n",
    "`VLOOKUP()` is like `INDEX()` in that it lets you look up values within a data block. It has the advantage that rather than you having to look and find the position of the cell to specify manually, you can specify the value you are looking for, and it automatically finds it. `VLOOKUP()` takes four arguments.\n",

    "The first argument to `SORT()` is the range of the dataset, not including the header row. The second argument is the number of the column to sort on, starting with 1 as the left-most column. Thirdly, you set the sort direction: pass `TRUE` to sort in ascending order (low to high, or A to Z) and `FALSE` for descending order. If you want to break ties by sorting on further columns, you can pass another column index and another direction for each column that you want to sort with.\n",
