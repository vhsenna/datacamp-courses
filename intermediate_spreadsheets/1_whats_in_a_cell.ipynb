    "Sometimes it is useful to check what type of data you have in each cell, since it may not be obvious just from looking at it. Google Sheets has a series of functions with names beginning \"IS\" that perform these checks, for example, [`ISTEXT()`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093297) takes a cell address like `B3` as an input, and returns the logical value `TRUE` if the cell contains text, or `FALSE` otherwise.\n",

    "Likewise, [`ISNUMBER()`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093296) checks for numbers in the cell, `ISDATE()` checks for dates, and [`ISLOGICAL()`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093351) checks for logical values.\n",
