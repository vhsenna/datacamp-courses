    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will explore logical operations using [unemployment data from 1972](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Ecdat/topics/Benefits). Each row corresponds to a woman was made unemployed because their seasonal job ended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest logical operation is [`NOT()`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093305), which negates its input. That is, `NOT(TRUE)` is `FALSE` and `NOT(FALSE)` is `TRUE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operations are useful for filtering datasets: you can keep only the rows where some condition is `TRUE`. Data filtering can be done using [`FILTER()`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093197), which takes two arguments. The first argument is the range of the data that you want to filter, and the second argument is the range of the logical condition to filter on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the data (not including the header row) is in `A2:E10`, and the final column contains the logical condition to filter on, you would type `=FILTER(A2:E10, E2:E10)`.\n",

    "1. In column `H`, negate the \"Is non-white?\" column to find women who are white.\n",
