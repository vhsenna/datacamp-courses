    "4. In `E11`, use `SUMPRODUCT` with `D3:D10` and `E3:E10`, and then divide by the total amount of credits (`D11`) to find the same result as `G11` (_much simpler!_).\n",
    "5. Find the grade corresponding to your weighted average GPA in `F11` by using the result in `E11` and an `HLOOKUP`. _You can use the existing `HLOOKUP` in cell `F10` and simply copy the value down into cell `F11`!_"
