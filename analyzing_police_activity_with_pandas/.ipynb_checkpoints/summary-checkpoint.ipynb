    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have learned the foundations of pandas, this course will give you the chance to apply that knowledge by answering interesting questions about a real dataset! You will explore the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyze the impact of gender on police behavior. During the course, you will gain more practice cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data. Analyzing Police Activity with pandas will give you valuable experience analyzing a dataset from start to finish, preparing you for your data science career!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 Preparing the data for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning your analysis, it is critical that you first examine and clean the dataset, to make working with it a more efficient process. In this chapter, you will practice fixing data types, handling missing values, and dropping columns and rows while learning about the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Are you more likely to get arrested at a certain time of day? Are drug-related stops on the rise? In this chapter, you will answer these and other questions by analyzing the dataset visually, since plots can help you to understand trends in a way that examining the raw data cannot.\n",
