    "\n",
    "Working with large quantities of data in spreadsheets can be difficult and time-consuming. Have you ever wished there was a quick and efficient way to organize and evaluate your data within seconds? Pivot Tables are your answer! In this course we will explore the world of Pivot Tables within Google Sheets, and learn how to quickly organize thousands of datapoints with just a few clicks of the mouse. We will analyze the Average rainfall across multiple US cities, the Top 10 of the Fortune Global 500, and a selection of Films released between 2010 and 2016. You will learn techniques such as sorting, subtotaling, and filtering your data using these real world examples. By the end of the course, you will be able to create your own custom pivot tables with datasets of any size!\n",
