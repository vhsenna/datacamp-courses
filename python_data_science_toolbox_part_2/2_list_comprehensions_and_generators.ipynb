Each row is a string that represents a timestamp, and you will access the _12th to 19th characters_ in the string to extract the time. Use `entry` as the _iterator variable_ and assign the result to `tweet_clock_time`. Additionally, add a conditional expression that checks whether `entry[17:19]` is equal to `'19'`."
