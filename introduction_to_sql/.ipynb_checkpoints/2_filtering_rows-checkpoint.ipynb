    "Congrats on finishing the first chapter! You now know how to select columns and perform basic counts. This chapter will focus on filtering your results.\n",

    "In SQL, the `WHERE` keyword allows you to filter based on both text and numeric values in a table. There are a few different comparison operators you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `=` equal\n",
    "- `<>` not equal\n",
    "- `<` less than\n",
    "- `>` greater than\n",
    "- `<=` less than or equal to\n",
    "- `>=` greater than or equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can filter text records such as `title`. The following code returns all films with the title `'Metropolis'`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE title = 'Metropolis';\n",

    "Notice that the `WHERE` clause always comes after the `FROM` statement!\n",
